# QuickDef: chrome extension to quickly explain unfamiliar text using OpenAI API
I want to optimize the user experience for online reading, especially in the context of news articles and research papers. This project allows users to efficiently read and understand online sources by generating real-time OpenAI API explanations for unfamiliar text that the user highlights. 

# Demo:
1. Navigate to article or website that you are reading.
2. For an unknown term, use your cursor to highlight the text that you'd like to explain.
3. A blue "explain" button will show; click the button.
4. A popup will spawn next to the text and immediately generate an explanation for the highlighted text provided by the OpenAI API.
5. Click the top-right "close" button of the popup or click outside of the popup to remove the popup.
6. Repeat steps 2-6 for any unfamiliar terminology that you don't know!

# Motivation
When reading a news article for example, the common approach upon seeing an unfamiliar term is to open another tab and go to Google or ChatGPT to explain the term. Especially in information-dense sources, this can accumulate to dozens of extra tabs and lots of transition time accumulated from 1) opening another tab, 2) navigating to ChatGPT or Google, and 3) typing or copying and pasting text you'd like to understand. Repeating this process numerous times can dramatically slow down your reading. This chrome extension accelerates your reading by removing the need to navigate to any other tab and by pre-prompting the OpenAI API to explain your desired terms. This greatly improves efficiency and retention for reading webpages.
